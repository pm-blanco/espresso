/**
 * @brief Floating-point exception trap.
 *
 * Thread-safe RAII-style mechanism to trap floating-point exceptions
 * (on platforms that support floating-point environment management) for
 * the duration of a scoped block. Exception traps are set when the object
 * is created; when getting out-of-scope, either normally or during stack
 * unwinding, the exception traps are automatically reset.
 *
 * Please note "exception" and "exception handling" have a specific meaning
 * in this context and are completely unrelated to C++ exceptions.
 * For more details, see annex F IEC 60559 "floating-point arithmetic"
 * in ISO/EIC 9899 @cite ISO-EIC-9899-1999 and chapter 7
 * "Exceptions and default exception handling" in
 * ISO/IEC 60559:2020(E) @cite ISO-EIC-60559-2020.
 *
 * The exception handling behavior is implementation-defined. For example,
 * GNU libc sends the @c SIGFPE signal on x86 architectures; it can be caught
 * by a signal handler that leverages stack environments and long jumps via
 * [`sigsetjmp()`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sigsetjmp.3.html).
 * On Armv8, trapping is controlled by FPCR flags; for more details,
 * see section C5.2.8 "FPCR, Floating-point Control Register" in the Armv8
 * manual @cite ARM-DDI-0487-2024. AppleClang sends the @c SIGILL signal
 * on Apple Silicon architectures.
 *
 * A modified singleton pattern is leveraged to guarantee only one trap is
 * active at any time; once expired, a new trap can be instantiated.
 * The @ref make_unique_scoped function returns a wrapper object whose
 * lifetime determines the trap duration. To set a trap in a recursive
 * function, use @ref make_shared_scoped instead.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include <instrumentation/fe_trap.hpp>
 * #include <cmath>
 * int main() {
 *   auto volatile zero = 0.;
 *   auto value = 1. / zero;  // generate NaN
 *   {
 *     auto trap = fe_trap::make_unique_scoped();
 *     value = 1. / zero;  // execution flow should be interrupted here
 *   }
 *   value = 1. / zero;  // generate NaN
 *   return std::isnan(value) ? 0 : 1;
 * }
 * @endcode
 * Build the code without fast-math and without any optimization
 * (optimizations always assume divisions by zero cannot happen):
 * @code{.sh}
 * g++ -std=c++20 -O0 -fno-fast-math -I../src/instrumentation/include \
 *     -I../src/config/include -Isrc/config/include \
 *     main.cpp ../src/instrumentation/src/fe_trap.cpp
 * ./a.out
 * }
 * @endcode
