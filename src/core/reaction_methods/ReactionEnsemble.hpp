 *  reaction ensemble at constant pressure, additionally employ a barostat!
 *  NOTE: a chemical reaction consists of a forward and backward reaction.
 *  Here both reactions have to be defined separately. The extent of the
 *  reaction is here chosen to be +1. If the reaction trial move for a
 *  dissociation of HA is accepted then there is one more dissociated ion
 *  pair H+ and A-. Implementation of @cite smith94c.
